## General info
This project is a follow along part of Angela Yu's Udemy Course in Web Development.
As I started from a template with a heading and 7 buttons. 
I added "addEventListeners" to first all of the 7 buttons and also to keyDown.
If any click or the corresponding keys were pressed then it went into the makeSound() and also a simple buttonAnimation().
Inside the makeSound() I learned the switch statement which used the key to determine the case and which sound to play.
